# constrained_multivariate_optimization
Developed a modular code in C which can be used to solve real world constrained multi-variable optimization problems. The code executes the objective function in three phases namely the bounding phase method, golden search section method, and finally, Powellâ€™s conjugate direction method in same order to predict the optimum solution. The penalty method dealt with the constraints in the problem
